## About the Application

The Building-to-3D Conversion Application allows you to convert 2D building plans (elevations and floor plans) into detailed 3D models that can be used with building energy modeling software. The application processes your uploaded images, detects architectural elements like walls, windows, and doors, and combines this information to create an accurate 3D representation of your building.

### Key Features

- Upload and process multiple building elevations (north, east, south, west)
- Upload and process multiple floor plans (one per building level)
- Set scale to convert from pixels to real-world measurements
- Automatic detection of walls, windows, doors, and other architectural elements
- 3D model generation with proper geometry and coordinates
- Export to gbXML format for use with energy modeling software
- Interactive 3D visualization
