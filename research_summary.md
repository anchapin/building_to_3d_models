# Building-to-3D Conversion Application Research Summary

## Image Processing Techniques

### OpenCV Capabilities for Edge Detection
- **Sobel Edge Detection**: Detects edges by looking for sudden changes in pixel intensity using gradient calculations in X and Y directions.
- **Canny Edge Detection**: More advanced algorithm that includes noise reduction, gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, and hysteresis thresholding.
- **Feature Detection**: Algorithms like Harris Corner Detection, SIFT, SURF, FAST, and ORB can identify distinctive features (especially corners) in architectural images.

### Feature Extraction for Architectural Elements
- Corner detection is particularly useful for identifying building elements like windows, doors, and wall intersections.
- Feature descriptors can be used to match similar elements across different views (elevations and floor plans).
- Blob detection can help identify larger architectural elements.

### Scale Conversion Methods
- Camera calibration techniques can be adapted to convert from pixels to real-world units.
- Reference objects with known dimensions can be used to establish a pixels-per-unit ratio.
- For CAD drawings, scale information is often embedded or can be derived from scale indicators.

### PDF to Vector Conversion for CAD Drawings
- PyMuPDF can extract vector graphics from PDF files, preserving the geometric information.
- Vector extraction preserves lines, curves, and shapes without loss of precision.
- For raster PDFs, preprocessing steps include image resizing, noise removal, segmentation, and vectorization.

## 3D Reconstruction Methods

### Approaches for Combining Elevation Views with Floor Plans
- Floor plans provide the horizontal (X-Y) layout while elevations provide vertical (Z) information.
- Matching corresponding elements between floor plans and elevations is key to accurate reconstruction.
- Topological relationships (connectivity, inside/outside) and spatial relationships (above/below) must be preserved.

### Libraries for 3D Modeling
- OpenCV for initial image processing and feature detection
- NumPy for mathematical operations and coordinate transformations
- Open3D or PyMesh for 3D mesh creation and manipulation
- Trimesh for geometric operations and mesh analysis

### Algorithms for 3D Geometry Creation
- Extrusion of 2D floor plan elements to create walls and basic structures
- Triangulation of elevation images to map textures and features to wall surfaces
- Geometric intersection algorithms to properly connect walls, floors, and roofs
- Boundary representation (B-rep) for defining solid objects

  - `<Surface>`: Defines walls, floors, roofs, etc.
  - `<Opening>`: Represents windows, doors, etc.
  - `<Construction>`: Defines material properties
  - `<WindowType>`: Defines window properties
  - Coordinate systems using `<CartesianPoint>` elements

### Building Elements for Energy Modeling
