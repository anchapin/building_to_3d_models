# Building-to-3D Conversion Application Architecture

## System Overview

The Building-to-3D Conversion Application is designed to transform 2D building elevations and floor plans into 3D models suitable for building energy modeling. The application will process CAD-derived images, detect architectural elements, combine information from multiple views, and generate a gbXML-formatted output.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend Interface
- **User Input Module**: Handles file uploads for building elevations and floor plans
- **Scale Configuration**: Allows users to specify scale indicators on images
- **Visualization Component**: Displays the generated 3D model
- **Export Interface**: Provides options to export the model in gbXML format

### 2. Image Processing Module
- **PDF to Vector Converter**: Converts PDF drawings to vector format
- **Edge Detection Engine**: Identifies edges of walls, windows, doors, and roofs
- **Feature Extraction System**: Detects and classifies architectural elements
- **Scale Conversion Utility**: Converts pixel measurements to real-world units

### 3. 3D Reconstruction Module
- **Floor Plan Processor**: Extracts building layout from floor plans
- **Elevation Processor**: Extracts height information from elevation views
- **Geometry Generator**: Combines floor plan and elevation data to create 3D geometry
- **Spatial Relationship Manager**: Maintains proper connections between building elements

### 4. gbXML Conversion Module
- **Building Element Mapper**: Maps 3D elements to gbXML components
- **Thermal Property Assigner**: Assigns default thermal properties to elements
- **XML Generator**: Creates properly formatted gbXML output
- **Validation System**: Ensures compliance with gbXML schema

## Data Flow

1. **Input Stage**:
   - User uploads building elevation images (minimum 4 for cardinal directions)
   - User uploads floor plan images (one per building level)
   - User specifies scale indicators on each image

2. **Processing Stage**:
   - Images are converted from PDF to vector format if necessary
   - Edge detection and feature extraction identify architectural elements
   - Scale conversion transforms pixel measurements to real-world units
   - Floor plans provide X-Y coordinates and room layouts
   - Elevations provide Z coordinates and vertical features

3. **Reconstruction Stage**:
   - Floor plan data establishes the building footprint and room divisions
   - Elevation data provides height information and vertical features
   - 3D geometry is generated by combining floor plan and elevation data
   - Spatial relationships ensure proper connections between elements

4. **Output Stage**:
   - 3D model is displayed for user verification
   - Building elements are mapped to gbXML components
   - Default thermal properties are assigned
   - gbXML file is generated and validated
   - User can download the gbXML file for use in energy modeling software

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Web Framework**: Next.js with React for the user interface
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js for displaying the 3D model
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS for styling

### Backend

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Accuracy of Feature Detection**: The system must accurately identify architectural elements from various drawing styles and qualities.

2. **Alignment Between Views**: Properly aligning elements between floor plans and elevations will be critical for accurate 3D reconstruction.

3. **Scale Consistency**: Ensuring consistent scale across different drawings will be essential for dimensional accuracy.

4. **Handling Complex Geometries**: The system should handle non-rectangular shapes and complex architectural features.

5. **Default Thermal Properties**: Appropriate default values must be assigned for thermal properties when specific information is not available.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Processing large or complex drawings may require optimization for reasonable performance.
